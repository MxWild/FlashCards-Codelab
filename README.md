FlashCards
==========

A simple flash cards app to be used for the GDG Stillwater Android Codelabs.

This tutorial is divided in 2 parts:

* [Part 1](https://github.com/fnk0/FlashCards-Codelab/blob/master/TutorialPart1.md)
* [Part 2](https://github.com/fnk0/FlashCards-Codelab/blob/master/TutorialPart2.md)


#### Basic Setup 

This tutorial will be assume that you have installed

1. Java SDK >= 1.7
2. AndroiD Studio beta >= 0.8.2
3. Android Built Tools 19.1.0
4. It will also asume that you have a working android device to debug or an emulator. I personally recommend [genymotion](http://www.genymotion.com/) emulator.


##### Assets:

If you want to use the same Icons that I used I strongly recomend that you [download the asset folder](https://github.com/fnk0/FlashCards-Codelab/tree/master/Assets) prior to start of the tutorial. 
You can also use your own icons to give your own unique touch to the app.
